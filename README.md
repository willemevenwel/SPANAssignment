## Problem Statement & Instructions

Read the problem statement, code a working solution (valid input and output will be provided)
and supporting tests using a language of your choice. Be prepared to explain your solution
during a review.

### The Problem

We want you to create a production ready, maintainable, testable command-line application that
will calculate the ranking table for a league.

### Input/output

The input and output will be text. Either using stdin/stdout or taking filenames on the command
line is fine.

The input contains results of games, one per line. See “Sample input” for details. 
The output should be ordered from most to least points, following the format specified in
“Expected output”.

You can expect that the input will be well-formed. There is no need to add special handling for
malformed input files.

### The rules

In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A loss is worth 0 points.
If two or more teams have the same number of points, they should have the same rank and be
printed in alphabetical order (as in the tie for 3rd place in the sample data).

### Guidelines

This should be implemented in a language with which you are familiar. We would prefer that
you use javascript, coffeescript, ruby, python, java, or C, if you are comfortable doing so. If
none of these is comfortable, please choose a language that is both comfortable for you and
suited to the task.

If you use other libraries installed by a common package manager (rubygems/bundler, npm,
